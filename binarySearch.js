// Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a specific element in a sorted list or array by repeatedly dividing the search space in half, reducing the number of possibilities with each comparison until the target is found or determined to be absent.

console.log(binarySearch([0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 34, 678, 899, 1000]));
