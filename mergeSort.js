// Merge sort is a popular and efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort an array or list of elements. The algorithm works by recursively dividing the input into smaller sub-arrays until each sub-array contains only one element (making them inherently sorted). It then merges these smaller sub-arrays back together in a sorted order to produce a fully sorted array. The key idea is to repeatedly combine two sorted sub-arrays into a larger sorted sub-array until the entire array is sorted. Merge sort is known for its stability and consistent performance, making it a reliable choice for sorting large datasets.
