// If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree: 
BFS
// If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
DFS --- BFS (DFS will take too long)
// if the tree is very wide: 
BFS --- DFS (BFS will need too much memory)
// if solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree: 
DFS
// determining wheter a path exists between two nodes: 
DFS
// finding the shortest path: 
BFS
